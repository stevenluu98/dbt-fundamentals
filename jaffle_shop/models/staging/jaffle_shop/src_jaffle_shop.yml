# This code checks for how fresh the data from the source is
# (e.g. give a warning if data is more than 12 hours old, error if more than 24 hours)
# You can run `dbt source freshness` to check the freshness of the source data
# BigQuery uses _batched_at, whereas Snowflake uses _etl_loaded_at
        #loaded_at_field: _batched_at
        #freshness:
          #warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
          #error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
